# Odin_recipes
Project: Recipes | Foundations Course

This is a practice project of the Foundations Course from The Odin Project. 

In this practice I will be building a website that consists of a main index page that will have links to a few recipes.

By completing this project I hope to consolidate the basic HTML knowledge from the previous modules in the Foundations Course.
