    <h4>What is Shabbat-don?</h4><br>
    <p><italic>Shabbat don</italic> is our family's version of the classic <italic>Tamago-don</italic> donburi (Japanese rice bowl) that we typically make during friday to be enjoyed during Shabbat (friday after sunset until saturday before sunset).
        Our iteration of the traditional Japanese <italic>Tamago-don</italic> features a paté of boiled eggs, grated garlic, green onion and <italic>gari</italic>, over <italic>shiro-gohan</italic> (Japanese rice).
    </p><br>
    <p>This recipe makes two servings.</p>
